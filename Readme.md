# Q1	Provide an overview and description of a standard source control process for a large project:
For a large software project, a **standard source control process** should be structured, collaborative, and adaptable to ensure code quality, stability, and team efficiency.  Here's an overview of a typical process that leverages modern version control best practices:  

1. **Central Repository Setup:**  
    * Establish a **central code repository** on a distributed version control system like *Git*.  This serves as the "single source of truth" for all project code.  
    * Define a **main branch**(e.g. `main`, `master`, or `trunk`) to maintian the stable, production ready version of the software.  This branch reflects the latest version of the code that has passed all the testing stages and is ready for deployment.  
    * Create **developement branches** that represents various lines of active developement, such as features, releases, or bug fixes.  


2. **Branching Strategy:**  
    * Branching is key in managing concurrent workstreams across a large team.  Use a structured branching model to avoid conflicts and maintain clear workflows: 

        * **Feature Branches:**   

            - Each new feature,bug fix, or task is developed on its own branch(e.g. `feature/new-login-page`).  
            - Developers create a branch from the main or developement branch, keeping changes isolated until the feature is reeady.  
            - Combine feature branches with **feature flags** to deploy code incrementally and control the release of features in production without modifiying the main codebase.  

        * **Release Branches:**  
            - Used to prepare for a software release, starting from the main branch(e.g. `release/1.0`).  
            - All final changes and critical fixes for a release are applied here, ensuring stability and quality before deployment.  
            - After deployment, changes are merged back into the main branch and potentially into other release branches for maintenance.  

        * **Hotfix Branches:**  
            - Used to address critical production issues quickly.  These branches are created directly from the main branch(e.g. `hotfix/urgent-issue`) and merged back after fixes are tested.  

        * **Task Branches:**  
            - For agile teams, task or issue branches(e.g. `task/JIRA-123`) are tied to specific user stories or bugs tracked in a tool like Jira, providing better traceability and alignment with project management.  

3. **Pull Requests and Code Reviews:**
    * Developers submit **pull requests** to merge their branch into the main or developement branch.  
    * Code reviews are mandatory before merging, ensuring quality control and adherence to coding standards.  
    * Pull requests should be detailed descriptions of changes, relevent issue numbers, and testing results to facilitate effective reviews.  

4. **Continuous Integration(CI) and Automated Testing:**  
    * Implement a *CI pipeline* that automatically builds and tests new code when changes are pushed to any branch.  
    * Use automated tests to validate code quality, minimise integration issues, and ensure compatibility across branches.  
    * Successful CI tests signal that a branch is safe to merge, failing tests alert developers to conflicts or issues that must be resolved.  

5. **Merging and Integration:**  
    * Encourage frequent merging to keep branches up-to-date with the latest changes from the main branch and prevent large, complex merges later.  
    * Use *fast-forward* or *squash merges* for clean histories in the main branch and to make tracking changes easier.  
    * Developers regularly **pull updates** from the main branch to ensure their branch remains compatible and up-to-date.  

6. **Traceability and Documentation:**  
    - Maintain clear commit messages and link changes to issue tracking systems like Jira.  
    - Annotated histories help developers understand changes, root causes of issues, and long-term design evolution, making it easier to work effectively with legacy code or plan new features.  

7. **Release Management and Deployment:**  
    - **Release branches** undergo thorough testing and QA to ensure that code is production-ready.  
    - Implement *tagging* to mark specific releases(e.g. `v1.0`, `v1.1`), making rollbacks easier if needed.  
    - Deploy from release branches or main branches based on the project’s deployment strategy, using *continuous delivery(CD)* practices where applicable.  

8. **Post-Deployment Support:**  
    - After deployment, use hotfix branches to address urgent issues while keeping the main branch stable.  
    - Merge hotfixes into release and main branches to maintain consistency.  

## Summary 
A standard source control process for a large project is centered around structured branching, disciplined merging, rigorous testing, and collaborative workflows.  It ensures that changes are controlled, traceable, and integrated smoothly across development teams, enabling efficient scaling, faster development cycles, and reliable software delivery.

# Q3	Outline a standard high level structure for a MERN stack application and explain the components

## Overview of MERN Stack
A standard high-level structure for a **MERN stack application** is organised into three main tiers: **frontend**, **backend**, and **database**, all interconnected to facilitate end-to-end development using JavaScript. Here’s how the architecture is generally structured:  
![Tech Stack](docs/techStack.png)  
- **Frontend (React.js)**
- **Backend (Express.js & Node.js)**
- **Database (MongoDB)**

Each of these tiers interacts through HTTP requests, JSON data exchange, and server communication to provide a seamless user experience.

## Components of a MERN Stack Application

![MERN ](docs/MERN.png)  

### 1. Frontend: React.js
- **Role**: Handles the client-side, rendering the user interface and managing user interactions.  
- **Structure**:  
  - **Components**: React is built on a component-based architecture where individual components represent distinct parts of the user interface(e.g. header, footer, forms, etc.).  
  - **State Management**: React uses hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to manage and manipulate the state of the application.  
  - **Routing**: Client-side routing is often managed using libraries like **React Router** to handle different URLs and display corresponding components without reloading the page.  
- **Data Flow**: React sends HTTP requests(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the backend to fetch, update, or delete data, using JavaScript libraries like Axios or Fetch API.  
- **Output**: The front end renders data dynamically and updates the view based on user actions.  

### 2. Backend: Express.js & Node.js
- **Role**: Manages the server-side logic, routes requests, and handles communication between the client and the database.  
- **Express.js**:  
  - A **minimalist web framework** for Node.js that helps manage HTTP requests and responses.  
  - **Routing**: Sets up routes to handle API requests(e.g. `/api/users`, `/api/posts`) and middleware for authentication, logging, or error handling.  
  - **Middleware**: Includes request parsers, authentication checks, and response headers to manage server functionality.  
- **Node.js**:  
  - Serves as the **runtime environment** for executing JavaScript code on the server.  
  - Handles **server hosting** and integrates Express.js for routing, middleware, and API endpoints.  
  - Uses **non-blocking I/O** and event-driven architecture, making it efficient for handling concurrent requests.  
- **API Communication**: The backend exposes RESTful APIs or GraphQL endpoints for the frontend to communicate with.  The data is typically sent and received in **JSON format**.  

### 3. Database: MongoDB  
- **Role**: Serves as the database layer, storing data and facilitating CRUD operations.  
- **Data Storage**:  
  - MongoDB is a **NoSQL document-oriented database** that stores data in **JSON-like documents**(BSON format).  
  - It offers a **flexible schema**, making it easy to adapt to changing data structures.  
- **Data Interaction**:  
  - **Mongoose**, an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, is often used to define schemas, models, and manage interactions with the database.  
  - It supports CRUD operations like `find()`, `insertOne()`, `updateOne()`, and `deleteOne()`, which correspond to HTTP methods in the backend.  
- **Scalability**: MongoDB’s distributed nature makes it scalable for handling large volumes of data and high-traffic applications.  

## How Components Interact in a MERN Stack Application
- **Frontend to Backend**:  
  - The frontend(React) sends requests to the backend(Express/Node) to fetch or update data.  For instance, when a user submits a form, React sends a POST request to an Express.js endpoint.  
- **Backend to Database**:  
  - The backend processes requests, performs data validation, and communicates with the MongoDB database using Mongoose or MongoDB Node.js driver.  
- **Backend to Frontend**:  
  - After performing the necessary operations on the data, the backend sends responses(often in JSON format) back to the frontend.  
- **Frontend Rendering**:  
  - React renders the data dynamically based on the response received, updating the UI accordingly.  

## Key Features of the MERN Stack Structure
- **Unified Language**: JavaScript is used throughout the stack, simplifying the development and reducing transition times between layers.  
- **JSON Data Flow**: JSON is used for data exchange across all tiers, from front-end requests to database storage.  
- **Component-Based Development**: Modular structure allows for easy maintenance, scaling, and debugging, as each tier handles a specific part of the application.  

This high-level structure makes the **MERN stack** an efficient choice for building scalable, dynamic web applications.

7. **Project Management with Trello and GitHub:**  

    - Trello kept tasks organised, and GitHub allowed for effective version control, making it easy to revert or track changes.  
    - **Effectiveness:** *Moderate*. Basic task management and version control were maintained, but more advanced tracking could be implemented.  
    - **Improvement:** For future projects, integrating continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) via GitHub Actions or a similar tool could improve productivity by automating testing and deployment.  Additionally, exploring Agile project management practices or tools like Jira might enhance team collaboration for larger projects.  

## Suggested Improvements for Future Projects:  

1. **Enhancing Security Practices:**  

    - While the project followed standard security practices(e.g., JWTs, bcrypt), there is room to enhance security.  Implementing features like two-factor authentication(2FA) could offer additional security layers, particularly for user authentication and data access.  

2. **Advanced Database Optimisation:**

    - Understanding advanced database optimisation techniques, like indexing frequently accessed fields or using caching solutions like Redis, could enhance performance, particularly for read-heavy applications. These optimisations would be beneficial as the application scales and usage increases.  

3. **Asynchronous Programming and Scalability:**

    * Implementing asynchronous handling for non-blocking operations(e.g., adding async capabilities in Flask) would improve scalability and response times, especially for high-traffic scenarios.  

4. **Enhanced API Documentation and Developer Experience:**

    - Using Swagger or OpenAPI specifications to auto-generate documentation would offer a better developer experience by providing interactive documentation for testing endpoints.  This would make it easier for developers to understand and integrate with the API.  

5. **User Feedback and User-Centric Design:**

    - Incorporating user feedback early in the design phase could ensure the API meets user needs more effectively. For example, getting feedback on the categorisation system and user roles could lead to better role definitions or feature enhancements.   

## Conclusion:

The combination of technical skills and project management strategies led to a successful completion of this project, with a robust, secure API meeting the requirements of a multi-user blogging platform.  Going forward, improvements like advanced security measures, and database optimisation would enhance future projects, particularly as they scale.  Additionally, experimenting with newer libraries and frameworks could improve development efficiency and ensure that applications are resilient, secure, and adaptable to users' evolving needs.
